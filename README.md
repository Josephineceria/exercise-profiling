Difference between JMeter and IntelliJ Profiler
Performance testing with JMeter is about simulating user loads and measuring an application's response time and stability under different conditions. It helps determine how well the application performs under various workloads. On the other hand, profiling with IntelliJ Profiler helps find weak points in the application that may not be apparent during performance testing.

Benefits of using IntelliJ Profiler
Identifies bottlenecks in the application code.
Offers detailed information about performance at the method, class, and line of code levels.
Helps optimize the application for better resource utilization.

Challenges in Performance Testing and Profiling includes handling complex infrastructure, such as distributed systems, can be difficult and may impact testing results and also interpreting large amounts of data during performance testing and profiling can be time-consuming and complex.

The challenges that i faced was to break down complex infrastructure into manageable components for testing and also how to utilize data visualization and analysis tools to make sense of the large amounts of data generated and handling inconsistent results.

When results from IntelliJ Profiler and JMeter differ, consider the following strategies:

Validate findings by cross-checking with other profiling or performance testing tools.
Analyze the specific scenarios where inconsistencies occur and identify potential causes.
Re-run tests and gather more data to confirm or refute the discrepancies.

Strategies for Optimizing Application Code
Prioritize improvements which focuses on addressing the most critical bottlenecks and performance issues identified during profiling and performance testing.

Make incremental changes which is done by implementing optimizations in small, manageable steps to minimize the risk of introducing new issues.

Continuous monitoring which i had to keep monitoring the application's performance after each optimization round to ensure sustained improvements.
